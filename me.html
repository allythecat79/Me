          <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>You may be wondering what my background is.  One of the defining things about my background is that I'm an Army brat.  My dad was a helipcopter pilot in the Army.  That means that I moved around a <em>lot</em>.</p>
            <p>Here is a list of the places I've lived:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Washington</li>
                <li>Germany</li>
                <li>Alabama</li>
                <li>Washington</li>
                <li>Italy</li>
                <li>Alaska</li>
                <li>Alabama</li>
                <li>Oregon</li>
              </ol>
          <h3>Programming</h3>
            <p>I decided to try computer programming because I want to start a career.  I've had a lot of jobs I've enjoyed, and some I haven't, but there hasn't been a lot of room for growth in these positions.  The tech industry will only keep growing.  I've gone from having an AppleIIc in my house to having an iPhone.  I've seen how tech has grown in leaps and bounds and it doesn't seem to have any limits.  I'm finding my class at Epicodus to be challenging yet rewarding.</p>
