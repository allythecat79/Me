          <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>You may be wondering what my background is.  One of the defining things about my background is that I'm an Army brat.  My dad was a helipcopter pilot in the Army.  That means that I moved around a <em>lot</em>.</p>
            <p>Here is a list of the places I've lived:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Washington</li>
                <li>Germany</li>
                <li>Alabama</li>
                <li>Washington</li>
                <li>Italy</li>
                <li>Alaska</li>
                <li>Alabama</li>
                <li>Oregon</li>
              </ol>


            <p>I have had a large variety of jobs, including being a bartender on West Burnside (<span class="important">pre-gentrification!</span>) and a doughtnuteer at Voodoo Doughnuts!  I have also worked in retail, as a hair stylist, waitress, barista, and currently I am a driver.</p>

          <h3>Programming</h3>
            <p>I decided to try computer programming because I want to start a career.  I've had a lot of jobs I've enjoyed, and some I haven't, but there hasn't been a lot of room for growth in these positions.  The tech industry will only keep growing.  I've gone from having an Apple IIc in my house as a child to having an iPhone now that I'm an adult.  I've seen how tech has grown in leaps and bounds and it doesn't seem to have any limits.  I'm finding my class at <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a> to be challenging yet rewarding.</p>
            <p>I have created several projects while attending <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a>.  Here are a few: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>A <a href="https://github.com/allythecat79/my-first-webpage/blob/master/knitting-blog.html">knitting blog</a> I created that I might actually continue with in the real world.  This page uses html and css.</li>
                <li>This is a webpage about <a href="https://github.com/allythecat79/my-first-webpage/blob/master/favorite-places.html">favorite places</a> that I made in my first week.  This page uses html and css.</li>
                <li>This is when I was learning about <a href="https://github.com/allythecat79/branching-merging-practice">branching and merging</a> on GitHub and I found it to be a little tricky.  This page uses html and css.</li>
                <li>When I was learning about floats and divs I made <a href="https://github.com/allythecat79/floats-practice">these pages</a>.  They use html and css.</li>
                <li>This is something called <a href="https://github.com/allythecat79/week-in-review">Week in Review</a>.  It was to help me learn about Bootstrap.  It uses html, css, and bootsrap.</li>
              </ul>
            <p>These may seem pretty simple and easy to you, but I assure you every single thing I've accomplished in this class has been hard for me to figure out.  I just keep trying though!</p>

            <h3>Fun stuff!</h3>
              <p>Now for the things I enjoy while enduring the tedium of this life!</p>
